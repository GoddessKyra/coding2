	<h1>Welcome to the Chestnut Ridge Conservancy</h1>
		<p><a href="http://www2.erie.gov/parks/index.php?q=chestnut-ridge">Chestnut Ridge Park</a> is a national treasure in our own backyard! Located in Erie County, just south of Buffalo in Orchard Park, NY, it is one of the largest county parks in the country. Chestnut Ridge is home to a place where fond memories have been, and will be, made for five generations and counting of Western New Yorkers.</p>

		<p>The <strong>Chestnut Ridge Conservancy</strong> is a <i>not-for-profit 501(c)(3)</i> organization established to work closely with the Erie County Department of Parks, Recreation and Forestry to help establish the direction for repairs and improvements in our beautiful park. Your generous contributions of time and talent make these improvements possible.</p>
