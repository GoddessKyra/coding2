1) PULP 716 COFFEE & COMICS 2) https://www.pulp716.com/ 3) I consider it a poorly designed website 4) It does not say when it was last updated. But based off of 'This week's comics; it was updated on 11/7/18. 5) The site's primary purpose it to inform and sell. They tell people on their website when they are open and closed, how to contact them and about seasonal events. They also tell viewers how much their products are 6) Their primary audience is people that live in the North Tonawanda, NY and Lockport, NY. SInce those are their two shop locations. But I would say their targets are teenagers to Adults in their 20s since they have pictures of people around those age and they have flavors that most 'younger' people like. 7) It is just organized how they see as important. But their is no set placement. 8) Yes, I am able to move around the site easily and go back and forth from one area to the next.  9) No, the site doesnt have any eye appeal. The words are slightly hard to read on the first page and it is quite bland. They also dont have anything about their products on their home page, just their hours. Everything is also centered. Things that are underlined look as if they are links. 10) They had things of what they need in their pages. But if they were just to inform and sell they didnt need the 'This week's comics' section. 11) The color isn't ADA compliant, their is no major contrast or types of colors such as Monochrome, Triad, Complementary, etc. They had a lot of negative space on the home page. 12) The images were too big in the home personally. I think they should have had their pictures either above their addresses and store hours or have the store hours and addresses on a separate page. Nothing took too long to load.
13) I liked how they made the grid of comic images in "This week's comics". It is nice and orderly. There is also enough negative space for the eyes to rest.
14) What I liked least about the site is they didnt keep the navbar capitalized in "This week's comics". I also dislike the background image in the Drinks Menu. They could have done more for looks.
