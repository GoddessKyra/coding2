1) W3Schools
2) https://www.w3schools.com/
3) I consider this a well designed site.
4) It doesn't say when it was last updated but the copyright at the bottom says 2018, so it has been updated at least this year.
5) The sites primary purpose is to inform/educate.
6) The primary audience are those who want to learn computer coding.
7) The site is organized by using the Fixed Side Bar.
8) It is easy to move around the site easily and it would be difficult to be lost. It also allows you to go back and forth between a page and your previous if you need to.The navigation scheme is obvious and clear. 
9) It is pretty simplistic but it is not repulsive and make me want to stop looking at it and never come back. 
10) Personally, I don't think they need to add or take anything away. They may have a bit too much on the home, but it was still used nicely.
11) I don't think it was too busy, Maybe with the window at half screen it was too busy but it wasn't annoying to look at or read.
12) None of the pictures or graphics were too big or flashy. It didn't take long to load, it loaded with the page.
13) What I like the best about the site is the navigation. It has the main areas then on the sidebar it would have the sub categories.
14) What I didn't like about the website is the color scheme. But, I am biased since i hate the color green.
