		<p><a href="http://www.lord.com">LORD Corporation</a> is headquartered in Cary, North Carolina, and is a privately held corporation that was founded in 1924. Our Stellar Technology sensing systems business specializes in the design, manufacture, and service of pressure transducers, pressure transmitters, load cells, force sensors, torque transducers, displacement sensors, and temperature transducers.</p>

		<p>Our engineering and manufacturing facility located in Amherst, New York, is a modern 50,000-square-foot, environmentally controlled building situated in a suburban technology park. Our sales and marketing center in Columbus, Ohio, coordinates sales activity with our regional sales offices in Houston, Texas, Salt Lake City, Utah, Cleveland, Ohio, Amherst, New York, and our domestic and international sales representatives' offices.

Our electronics development capabilities include circuit design and analysis, PCB development and layout, and firmware/software development. In manufacturing, we are certified to the highest level of space grade soldering, qualified in TIG and laser welding, certified in configuration control practices, cleanliness practices, and traceability control. Our total quality system is registered as an ISO9001 quality system with supplemental quality requirements added for specific customers' needs.
