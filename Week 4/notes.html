DAY ONE - Margin and Height/Width
Shorthand for margin is top right bottom left, it goes clockwise
margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left
margin

If there are 3 values, it will look at its opposite side for the pixels
right - left
top - bottom

if there are 2 values, it is the same as the one above

If there is only one, all four will be that size
There is no float center, margin can "go around" that

0 means no margin, auto means it will take the left over width from the browser and divide it by 2 and place it on the left and right sides

Width is needed because block takes up the entire width, auto will have nothing to be divided by 2
Browser width is 600px

Width is just going to set it at 700 no matter the browser window size, max-width sets it up to 700px

DAY TWO - Padding
Padding goes between the border and the content (inside of border)
Margin goes between border and the top/bottom or sides (outside of border)

In the skeleton CSS, the element width is 570px
Margin can be negative, padding cannot be negative
Very similar to margin
Goes clockwise for shorthand

DAY THREE -Anchor Pseudo Classes
Padding will give more area to click, margin will not

DAY FOUR - Border and Outline
border-style is shorthand
 - -
l  border-top-style:
l  border-right-style:
l  border-bottom-style:
l  border-left-style:
 - -
Top, right, bottom, left is the shorthand order

border-width: thin (1px), medium (4px), thick (6-7px)
If you don't define a style but have a width, it wouldn't show

If you don't specify color, the default would be the text color

border shorthand width - style - color

The largest size on the radius depends on the size of the content

Outline does not effect size or dimension of the element
Do all sides or none ( no one side)
One style
Outline-color:
Outline-width:
Outline-offset:
Outline shorthand: width, style, color
Outline-offset 

DAY FIVE
For ones with specific ids and classes, the order matters
For example;
	#menu li {
		means that the list is inside the menu
			<span id="menu>
				<li>Content</li>
			</span>
	li #menu {
		means that the id is in the li
			<li id="menu"> Content </li>
