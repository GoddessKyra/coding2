	<h2>Leasing Testimonials:</h2>

	<h3>ARG saved us over $130,000 on our office lease.</h3>
We had been a tenant in the space for over 10 years. The Landlord had already sent us the renewal offer. We were ready to sign and thought the Landlord provided us with a good deal. Our attorney advised us to hire a professional real estate consultant to review the business terms of the lease. We had always negotiated our lease on our own and initially thought it was a waste of time. We were advised that it would cost more to hire a consultant. We were subsequently informed that the services were "free" as the Landlord pays the commission. Ultimately we saved money. American Realty Group is now an integral part of our team to assist us with our real estate decision making process.
