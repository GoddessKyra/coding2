	<h1>History</h1>
		<p>American Expediting was founded in 1983 by then - University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business student Victor Finnegan as a one-man, rush/same day courier operation.</p>
		<p>Within one year, his business was racing past competitors, and by 1988, American Expediting was one of Philadelphia's leading time-critical delivery organizations. Over the course of its growth Vic has worn many hats including CEO, customer service representative, driver, accountant and head of sales.</p>

		<p>While Vic no longer delivers in person, his organization continues to deliver service excellence to its growing customer base from <a href="http://americanexpediting.com/coverage/">40 locations nationwide</a>. American Expediting's services have expanded to encompass air services, a national logistics program, distribution and warehousing, fulfillment, facilities and fleet management, and temporary staffing.</p>
