In body, you can also do an image

To path, you start by the current folder to the folder it is in

The image repeats like a grid
x ->
y   - - -	 - - -
l   l      l	l      l
v   - - -	 - - -
     - - -	 - - -
    l      l	l      l
     - - -	 - - -

Reason for having different images: for one to be header
You have to have background color
To have one image (no repeat) use background-repeat: no-repeat
3 ways to tell background position:

Keywords	
x			y
left	     	      top
center 	    center
right		    bottom

Percentages
x			y
0-100%		0-100%
Its like a grid, 0 on top/left to 100 on the bottom/right
So 100, 100 is on the bottom right and 0, 0 would be on the top left

Coordinates
x			y
px		       px
If you use coordinates, and someone shrinks their browser page, it would not show up, while on percentages it would

For background: it must be in order of the code (color, image, repeat, attachment then position)

COMMENTS IN CSS: /* content */

FOR EXAMPLE;
background-position: right top;
would make it in the image in the right top
