	<h3>Movie Quotes</h3>

		<p style="color:red;font-family:courier;">Ray Arnold stated:</p>

		<blockquote cite="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/quotes?ref_=tt_ql_trv_4">The lysine contingency is intended to prevent the spread of the animals in case they ever get off the island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. <mark>The animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.</mark> Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.</blockquote>
