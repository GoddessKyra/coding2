<p>Words are like wind. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come. Winter is coming. The War of the 5 kings. The tourney of Ashford Meadows.</p>

<p>What is dead may never die. Dunc the Lunk, thick as a castle wall. The winds of Winter. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come. Winter is coming.</p>

<p>The War of the 5 kings. You know nothing, Jon Snow. Pay the iron price. Words are like wind. Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne.</p>

<p>The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons. May the Father judge him justly. I would like a trial by combat. The wolf and the lion. The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons.</p>
