* should not be used, only to test things
Adds weight to browser, so it takes longer to load
 x + y will only style the first child of the element
    ~So if it was ul + li, it would only add that style to the lirst li after the ul
    ~If you want to do the 2nd one instead: ul + p + p

If you have an H1 before the p first-child will not work. Since the parent isnt selected
