<h2>position: static;</h2>

<p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is
always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:</p>

<div class="static">
This div element has position: static;
</div>

<h2>position: relative;</h2>

<p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position:</p>

<div class="relative">
This div element has position: relative; with a left property of 30px;
</div>

<h2>position: fixed;</h2>

<p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled:</p>

<div class="fixed">
This div element has position: fixed;
</div>

<h2>position: absolute;</h2>

<p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):</p>

<div class="relative2">This div element has position: relative;
  <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute;</div>
</div>


<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<img src="images/flowers.jpg" alt="flowers" width="500" height="335">
<p>Because the image has a z-index of -1, it will be placed behind the text.</p>
