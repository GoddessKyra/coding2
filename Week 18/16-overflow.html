<h2>CSS Overflow</h2>

<h3>overflow: visible;</h3>

<p>By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it renders outside the element's box:</p>

<div class="vis">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>overflow: hidden;</h3>

<p>With the hidden value, the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content is hidden:</p>
<p>Try to remove the overflow property to understand how it works.</p>

<div class="hide">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>

<h3>overflow: scroll;</h3>

<p>Setting the overflow value to scroll, the overflow is clipped and a scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box. Note that this will add a scrollbar both horizontally and vertically (even if you do not need it):</p>

<div class="scrl">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>

<h3>overflow: auto;</h3>

<p>The auto value is similar to scroll, only it add scrollbars when necessary:</p>

<div class="ato">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>

<h3>overflow-x and overflow-y</h3>

<p>You can also change the overflow of content horizontally or vertically.</p>

<p>overflow-x specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content.<br>
overflow-y specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content.</p>

<div class="xy">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>
