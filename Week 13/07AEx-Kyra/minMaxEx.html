        <p>But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be.</p>
        
        <p>I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. We'll play with clouds today. It's important to me that you're happy. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction.</p>
        
        <p>Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.</p>
        
        <p>It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It's about to freeze me to death. You need the dark in order to show the light. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be.</p>
        
        <p>La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people.</p>
        
        <p>I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. A little happy sunlight shining through there. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. We don't want to set these clouds on fire.</p>
        
        <p>Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it.</p>
